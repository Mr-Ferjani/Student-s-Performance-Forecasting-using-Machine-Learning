1- Setup Github (Repository):
	a) New Environment: conda create --name venv python=3.8 -y
	b) Setup.py
	c) requirements.txt
2- Src Folder and Package Build
3- Set Project Structure:
	* Components that contain all modules:
	 a) Data Ingestion (Read dataset)
	 b) Data Transformation
	 c) Model Trainer
	  ==> At bigger projects, more modules can be added such as model evaluation, data validation
	 * Pipeline (Trainin/prediction):
	 a) Training Pipeline
	 b) Prediction Pipeline
	 * Add Utils (modules that are used in the entire application), exception handeling, logger

4- Project Problem / EDA/ Feature Engineering/ Model Training
5- Data Ingestion 
6- Data Transformation
7- Model Training and Validation
8- Prediction Pipeline Using Flask Web App

* From Notebook -> Modular Programming -> CI/CD Pipeline
